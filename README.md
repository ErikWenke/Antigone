# Antigone
## What is Antigone?
Antigone is a Saver Use project. 

But what is "Saver Use"? It is the philosophy or practise to reduce every possible risk that can be avoided while consuming any (legal or illegal) substance. Or atleast reduce the damage that could be done.
## Goals and Limits
The goal of this project is to be a checklist like guide. You give the information and it will tell you what risks are present. The consideration is in your hands. It will not tell you WHAT TO DO or WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO. It also does not advocate the use of ANY SUBSTANCE. The best practise is to NOT TAKE ANY SUBSTANCE AT ALL.
## How is Antigone?
Antigone is a princess but, more importantly, one of four daughters of Oedipus. The Guy in greek mythology who was doomed by fate and there for poked out his eyes. Now he wonders around in darkness. Guided by Antigone.
